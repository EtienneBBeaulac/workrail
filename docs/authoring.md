# Workflow Authoring Guide

Create custom workflows to guide AI agents through your team's processes.

## Read this first (v1 vs v2)

WorkRail is in a transition period. Authoring docs are split to avoid v1/v2 confusion:

- **v2 authoring** (design-locked direction): `docs/authoring-v2.md`
- **v1 authoring** (current shipped system): `docs/authoring-v1.md`

## Canonical references

- v2 authoring: `docs/authoring-v2.md` (and `docs/design/workflow-authoring-v2.md`)
- v1 authoring: `docs/authoring-v1.md`
