  "description": "A bias-resistant, evidence-driven relocation workflow for the United States. Helps users discover what they care about, generate a broad candidate pool (including optional custom areas), screen it with strict caps, deep-dive shortlisted areas, and produce a master dossier plus per-location profile docs with a transparent, explainable weighted ranking.",
  "preconditions": [
    "User is considering relocation within the United States (v1 scope).",
    "Agent can research the web and/or use user-provided sources.",
    "Agent can write files to maintain a durable paper trail (or paste canonical artifacts if file writing is unavailable)."

  "clarificationPrompts": [
    "Are you relocating within the US only (this v1 workflow), or do you want an international-capable version?",
    "What is your expected timeline to move (0-3 months, 3-12 months, 12+ months)?",
    "What is your household situation (single, couple, family with kids, multi-generational, etc.) and which constraints matter most?",

    "MISSION: Help the user pick where to move by systematically discovering preferences, researching candidates, and producing an evidence-backed, explainable ranking.",
    "ANTI-ANCHORING: Do not deep-dive a single favorite city early. Generate a broad pool first, then screen, then shortlist, then deep dive.",
    "PAPER TRAIL: Maintain a master dossier and per-location profile docs. Every key claim must be sourced and graded (High/Medium/Low).",
    "DATA VARIANCE: If a metric is unavailable or inconsistent, record it as Unknown and apply the explicit missing-data policy (never silently assume).",
    "BOUNDARIES (CRITICAL): Prevent boundary drift by representing every candidate as an AreaSpec (what exactly the 'area' is). Never switch boundaries mid-run without logging it.",
    "CUSTOM AREAS: v1 supports custom areas via a single custom boundary mode: radius (center + radiusMiles). More precise custom modes can be added later.",
    "SCREENING MUST SCALE: First-pass screening must be intentionally thin (dealbreakers + top criteria only) with strict time/source/claim caps. Deep dives are where detail lives.",
    "BRANCHING: Keep this workflow generic via lightweight modules (kids/schools, commute, transit, climate risk, etc.) rather than rigid personas.",
    "OUTPUT SHAPE: One master dossier + one profile doc per shortlisted candidate. Keep formatting consistent to enable side-by-side comparison.",
    "QUALITY GATES: Require user confirmation at criteria lock-in, shortlist selection, and final ranking."
